Viewing a diff between two version narrows the problem down to only the differences.  Without this it would be impossible to find the problem in a practical length of time.

Using History - You could use some old code that was deleted from the current version.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
The Git-like ones are more sophisticated and allow tracking on a project level.  Google docs for instance is not generally tracking projects, but tracking a single entity, like a spreadsheet.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
log gives you a list of all changes.  diff shows you what those changes look like.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
You always know you can discard your errors and get back to a known version.  Like having a net in case you fall.

ow that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
Working with branches.
