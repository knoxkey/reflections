When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
You might do this if you are working from a computer away from your local one.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
If you are working on your local project, you would want to control when and how the your project is kept in sync with the remote. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks clone copy someone a repository to another repository on GitHub.
Clones copy a repository locally, from GitHub to a local repository, or from a local repository to GitHub.
Branches create a new line of commits in a single repository.
