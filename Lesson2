What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A .git file is created to hold metadata for your repository.  Without it, git has nothing do do with the directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The repository only hold the files that are to be committed next. The repository and the working directory both hold all the other files as well.
